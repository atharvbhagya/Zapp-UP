# Zapp-UP
this is a project for CS 207 by Group 8.

In this project we use the MERN stack to put together a mini social network website,
where you can chat with different users individually and also make posts and comments on a common page simultaneously !

How to run:
1) Simply Open the Code Files in the vs code then open a new terminal and run command "npm start".
2) then open Any browser and open link "localhost:4000". this will load the website locally with all the implemented features.
